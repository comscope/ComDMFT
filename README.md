# 1. ComDMFT 

A computational materials physics code for simulating correlated quantum materials using Dynamic Mean Field Theory (DMFT) and its extension. It can calculate the electronic structure within three different mathods:

  - charge self-consistent LDA+Gutzwiller,
  - charge self-consistent LDA+DMFT,
  - and ab initio LQSGW+DMFT
  
For the copyright and license information, please see Copyright.txt and license.txt. 
  
# 2. New version release announcement
## A release for the 2021 Comscope Summer School, available on the 2021ComscopeSummerSchool branch
   -Minor differences from the 2021 Official Release, which was a few weeks earlier.  New tutorials are added.

## 2021. 2. 26, available on the 2021OfficialRelease branch
   - Updated interface to Flapwmbpt. Now ComDMFT requires a single input file for FlapwMBPT, the DMFT calculation, and its postprocessing. 
   - Now ComDMFT provides an option to calculate quasiparticle bandstructures within LDA+DMFT as well as LQSGW+DMFT.
   - Now ComMDFT provides options to choose "s"- or "p"-type corrlated orbitals.

## 2020. 1. 6, available on the 2020OfficialRelease brance
   - Now ComDMFT can calculate antiferromagnetically ordered phase. Please go to tutorial directories (install_directory/tutorials/lda_dmft/NiO_afm and install_directory/tutorials/lqsgw_dmft/NiO_afm). Read pdf files to learn how to calculate the electronic structures of antiferromagnetically ordered NiO.  You have two choices of charge self-consistent LDA+DMFT and LQSGW+DMFT.

## 2019. 1. 4
   - The first version has been released!!!
   - Please go to tutorial directory(install_directory/tutorials) to learn how to calculate the electronic structures of NiO, MnO, and FeSe. You have three choices of charge self-consistent LDA+Gutzwiller, charge self-consistent LDA+DMFT, and LQSGW+DMFT.

    - ifort, icpc and mkl
  - MPI

    - open MPI (mpif90, mpicc, mpicxx, mpirun, etc. Check https://www.open-mpi.org/)
  - Python3 (required package : numpy, scipy, tabulate, itertools, mpi4py, cython, matplotlib, Builtins, sympy, pymatgen, pyyaml and h5py)
  
## Optional package
  - Data storage in Parallel HDF5 is also supported. Parallel HDF5 library (Check https://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/release/obtain5.html)

- gw -- FlapwMBPT code(https://www.bnl.gov/cmpmsd/flapwmbpt/)
- wannier90-2.1 -- the most recent version of Wannier90.

## Compile ComDMFT package.
- First, define the installation directory in the shell. For example in bash shell, use the following command adds $COMSUITE_BIN to your system $PATH

      export COMSUITE_BIN=install_directory/bin
- Then, the compilers, libraries, and flags should be defined in the arch.mk file. An example to install ComDMFT on Cori at NERSC is as follows.

       ##### fortran
       F90 = ifort
       PF90 = ftn
       compfl = -O3
	   
       ##### f2py
       fortran2python = f2py -c --fcompiler=intelem --compiler=intelem	   

       ### phdf5
       USE_HDF5 = defined  ### comment out this line if you don’t want to compile with hdf5 (for LDA+DMFT and LQSGW+DMFT)

       ifdef USE_HDF5
          FPPFLAGS += -DUSE_HDF5
	      F90 = h5pfc
       endif

       ### C and C++
       CXX = CC
       CXX_MPI = CC -DHAVE_MPI
	   
	   ##### lapack library
       LAPACK_LIB = -mkl

       #### ComCTQMC

       BASE_CPPFLAGS = -DNDEBUG
       BASE_LIBS = -lm
       CXXFLAGS_CTQMC = -std=c++11 -fexceptions -Wall -O3

       #### ComRISB ######################

       FIX_FORM = -fixed
       FREE_FORM = -free
       PF90_RISB=h5pfc
       CXXFLAGS_RISB = -O2
	   
	   
	 Below is the meaning of the each flag in the arch.mk.
  - F90 = ifort ; identify Fortran compiler for a serial fortran program
  - PF90 = ftn ; identify Fortran compiler for a MPI fortran program
  - compfl = -O3 ; compilation flag for Fortran programs
  - fortran2python: fortran to python interface generator
  - USE_HDF5 = defined ; compilation option to enable program to read and write data in hdf5 file format (only works for LDA+DMFT and LQSGW+DMFT for now). Comment out this line if you dont want to compile with hdf5
  - CXX = CC ; standard environment variable to identify the serial C++ compiler. 
  - CXX_MPI = CC; identify the parallel C++ compiler
  - FPPFLAGS += -DUSE_HDF5; preprocessor definition to compile with HDF5 file format
  - F90 = h5pfc; identify Fortran compiler for hdf5 file format
  - LAPACK_LIB = -mkl ; specify LAPACK library
  - BASE_CPPFLAGS = -DNDEBUG ; generic C-preprocessor flags. NDEBUG stands for no-debug code.
  - BASE_LIBS = -lm ; generic libraries that are compiler independent. The -lm flag requests the math library.
  - CXXFLAGS_CTQMC = -std=c++11 -fexceptions -Wall -O3 ; list of compilation flags for C++ compiler for ComCTQMC. The -std=c++11 specifies that the code is written based on the C++ 2011 standard. The -fexceptions flag tells the compiler that it should generate code that support exceptions. The -Wall turns on all warnings.
  - FIX_FORM = -fixed: specify Fortran standard fixed format
  - FREE_FORM = -free: specify free format
  - PF90_RISB = h5pfc: identify hdf5 supported fortran compiler for COMRISB. Here we note that ComRISB support hdf5 partially, so that “USE_HDF5=defined” should be commented out for ComRISB.
  - CXXFLAGS_RISB = -O2: c compiler option for ComRISB
- After setting up arch.mk, you need to run the following commands:

          make clean
          make

  All executable files then are in bin directory (You do not need to create bin directory by yourself).
